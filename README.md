### Hey, I'm Sam

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com), building tools that help developers work with AI.

## Current Focus

**[GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)** - I build and maintain GitHub's official Model Context Protocol server, enabling AI agents to interact with GitHub.

**[Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol)** - Contributing to the MCP specification, particularly around [security best practices](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/641) and [session management](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/648).
