### Hello & Welcome

- I currently work here at [GitHub](https://github.com)
- frequently [participate in issues](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/pull/355) to help get them closed.
- sometimes contribute [documentation](https://github.com/django/django/pull/9283) to projects.
- I have contributed in various languages such as [Rust](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/pull/2021/files), [TypeScript](https://github.com/palantir/plottable/pull/3087), [Shell Scripting & JS](https://github.com/jdxcode/gh/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASamMorrowDrums+is%3Aclosed), [Golang](https://github.com/heroku/cli/pull/1)
- I enjoy [writing test cases](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/aoc2/blob/day8/day7/src/main.rs#L141).

## Projects
 
- I have been contributing to a Rust WASM Flash emulator called [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASamMorrowDrums)
- Bootstrapping a [Rust GTK app](https://github.com/Wizard-Notes/app) has been fun to start (although I haven't had much time to work on it yet).
- Before contributing to Ruffle I had started learning Rust through Advent of Code - [here is the code I wrote](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/aoc2).
- I built and deployed a CV website to learn Next.Js, Tailwind CSS and Netlify, and completed the first release in about 2 hours. Still a work in progress, [see how it is going](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/cv).
